# Company-Sentiment-Project
This project is designed to crawl an Australian stock market forum and analyse sentiment towards stocks. The data can then be compared against stock trends to see if there is any correlation.
The crawler will gather the wanted url's and then the scraper will input the wanted content into a database. The data will then be used to create graphs etc which can then be compared against stock history of every Australian company on the forum.
The project will start off with just one forum to test the results, howeve, if it proves to be successful then the project has the potential to expand to other websites and forums.
